## 🏛️ Open Data + LLMS
⚡Bring insights to non-technical users with Text-To-SQL Apps using LLMs and Open Data ⚡

How can we support production-ready use cases of Large Language Model components that are simply not 
just an API wrapper or "framework" but tools that provide control and visibility to model outputs.

Open Data: Leverages public data sources on top of the language model to demonstrate scalable applications that meet
compliance and privacy goals.

### 🤔 What is this?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, not just enabling developers to build apps but also helping democratize data analysis. Leveraging LLMs to run analysis on public data
related use cases is a simple way of showing value to processes.

This repository leverages Open Data to provide example use cases 

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. 

Common examples of these applications include:

### ❓ Question/Answering on Open Census Data
Dataset: Census 2021 
End-to-end Example:(Open.DataGovs.com)

### 📖 Documentation

How-To examples (Demo)

#### Reference (full API docs)
- 🚀 What can this help with?
There are six main areas that LangChain is designed to help with. These are, in increasing order of complexity:

- 🔗Quality & Compliance:
LLM(s) vary in quality based on the data and can give bad data outputs we mitigate this by transforming the data to meet standards and notifying users of issues with their datasets. 

📃 LLMs and Prompts:
This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.

### 💁 Contributing

As an Open Data project, we showcase numerous public datasets that can be brought in to run your own examples. 

We encourage folks as they build their own to showcase here and cite the data sources.

### 💰 Commercialization

We’re a small, self-funded, fully-distributed team in the U.S. and we do not solicit users leveraging the public data tooling. We use OSS for those tools. 

We get paid through customers who we support with private data use cases upon request and only on requests for membership. That membership is used to fuel continued community efforts.
