## üèõÔ∏è Open Data + LLMS
‚ö°Bring insights to non-technical users with Text-To-SQL Apps using LLMs and Open Data ‚ö°

How can we support production-ready use cases of Large Language Model components that are simply not 
just an API wrapper or "framework" but tools that provide control and visibility to model outputs.

Open Data: Leverages public data sources on top of the language model to demonstrate scalable applications that meet
compliance and privacy goals.

### ü§î What is this?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, not just enabling developers to build apps but also helping democratize data analysis. Leveraging LLMs to run analysis on public data
related use cases is a simple way of showing value to processes.

This repository leverages Open Data to provide example use cases 

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. 

Common examples of these applications include:

### ‚ùì Question/Answering on Open Census Data
Dataset: Census 2021 
End-to-end Example:(Open.DataGovs.com)

### üìñ Documentation
Please see here for full documentation on:
How-To examples (Demo)

This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.

### üíÅ Contributing

As an Open Data project, we showcase numerous public datasets that can be brought in to run your own examples. 

We encourage folks as they build their own to showcase here and cite the data sources.
